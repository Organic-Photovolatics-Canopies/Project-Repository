- Applied new tools, including Blender scripting for synthetic data and streamlined preprocessing, to improve training efficiency.  

**Technical Skills Gained:**  
- Python, Blender scripting, and synthetic data generation  
- Machine learning model training, evaluation, and deployment  
- Data preprocessing and pipeline development  

**Non-Technical Skills Gained:**  
- Professional communication in team and mentor settings  
- Problem-solving through experimentation and iteration  
- Collaboration and project coordination  

**Other Relevant Work Experience**  
*Leader — English Teaching Club, Vietnam (High School)*

## Project Sought
For my capstone project, I am seeking a project that leverages **machine learning and data science** to solve practical, real-world problems. I am particularly interested in:  
- Computer vision and image recognition  
- Synthetic data creation and augmentation  
- Hands-on experience with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation  

I am also open to interdisciplinary projects that combine technical solutions with user needs, where I can contribute both my technical expertise and collaborative skills.
