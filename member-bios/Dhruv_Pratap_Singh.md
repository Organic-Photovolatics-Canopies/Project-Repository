**Major:** B.S. Computer Science, University of Cincinnati — *Graduating May 2026*

## Summary
Computer science senior focused on **AI for document analysis** and **multi‑agent systems**. Three Siemens rotations across research and product groups; recognized as a **Top‑10 Impact Intern**. I take fuzzy ideas to working prototypes with Python, LLMs, and lightweight UIs.

## Experience
**R&D Co‑op — Siemens Digital Industries Software (Advanced Solutions / T&I)** | *Jan 2025 – Aug 2025*  
- Built the **Customer Security Questions (CSQ) Automation** pipeline: parsed Word/Excel, extracted security concerns, and matched Q&A using **Google Gemini (Vertex AI)**.  
- Added **confidence scoring**, **repeat‑match consistency tests**, and modular validation; exposed options in a **Gradio** UI.  
- Integrated internal tools into **Agent‑to‑Agent (A2A)** workflows; debugged **SSE streaming** and task‑state issues.

**AI Intern — Siemens (Advantage AI team)** | *Summer 2024*  
- Prototyped AI assistants and prompt‑engineering workflows; compared **OpenAI/Gemini/Llama** and built evaluation harnesses.  
- Promoted internal adoption with “work smarter with AI” examples and documentation.

**Python Workshop Instructor — CEAS, Univ. of Cincinnati** | *Spring 2023*  
- Taught **Python/SQL** workshops; supported students in **Jupyter/Colab**; ran 1‑on‑1 consults.

## Research & Academic Projects
**AS↔BS Transfer Pathways Optimization (with Dr. David Reeping)** | *2024–2025*  
- Matched community‑college **AS** plans to **BS** programs; minimized lost credits using **Pandas** + equivalency tables.  
- Built an interactive comparison UI and scoring logic for candidate pathways.

**A2A Multi‑Agent & MCP Integrations** | *2024–2025*  
- Integrated custom **FastMCP** tool servers (weather, country info, SysML) into **Google A2A** sample agents.  
- Implemented a **LangGraph‑style** CLI agent with streaming tool calls and conversational memory.

**Gödel Agent Experiments** | *2024–2025*  
- Ran self‑evolving agent loops that refine a `solver()` function; added a minimal UI to visualize iterations and code diffs.

## Selected Skills
- **Languages/Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, FastAPI, Gradio, Git/GitLab, Markdown  
- **AI/LLM:** Vertex AI (Gemini 1.5 Pro), OpenAI GPT‑4 class, prompt design & evaluation, retrieval, JSON I/O  
- **Agents:** Google **A2A** (SDK/CLI), **LangGraph**, **FastMCP** servers, SSE/streaming  
- **Data/Docs:** PDF/Word/Excel parsing, EasyOCR, Textract; CSV/Excel export and reporting

## Highlights
- **Top‑10 Impact Intern** (Siemens DISW).  
- Led demos and internal docs for AI adoption; collaborated across US/EU/Asia time zones.  
- Advocate of reproducible pipelines (clear prompts, config, versioned outputs).
