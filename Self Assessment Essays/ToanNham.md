Senior Design Project Essay

Introduction

My senior design project is about using AI to find transparent solar panel materials for farms. The idea is to make solar panels that can go over vineyards without blocking too much light for the crops. I'm working on the machine learning part of the project. We're using graph neural networks to predict which molecules would make good solar panels. This combines computer science with chemistry and renewable energy. It's a good opportunity to apply what I've learned in my classes to a real problem.

College Curriculum

My CS classes have prepared me for this project. CS 2028C Data Structures taught me how to organize data efficiently, which helps when working with large molecular databases. CS 5137 Machine Learning covered neural networks and how to train models, which is what I'll be doing for predicting molecular properties. CS 5165 Cloud Computing showed me how to use cloud resources for big computational tasks. These classes gave me the technical skills I need for building the AI system. I also learned how to break down complex problems and test my solutions properly.

Co-op Experience

My co-op at Kinetic Vision gave me real experience with machine learning projects. I worked on the full process from data preparation to deploying models. I learned that good data pipelines and testing are just as important as the model itself. The co-op taught me about version control, documentation, and working on a team. I saw how to take models from notebooks to actual production systems. This experience will help me avoid common mistakes and build something that actually works.

Motivation

I'm excited about this project because it combines AI with solving climate problems. Using machine learning to speed up materials discovery for solar panels feels like meaningful work. I like that the project is interdisciplinary and I have to learn some chemistry and physics too. The technical challenges of working with molecular graphs and implementing GNN models will push my skills. It's also cool to be building something new instead of just following a tutorial. This project will give me good experience for working in AI research or applications after graduation.

Approach and Expected Results

I'm starting by building data pipelines to process the molecular database into a format the GNN can use. Then I'll train models to predict properties like energy gaps and efficiency based on research papers we're reading. I'm focusing on making clean, documented code that my team can work with. I expect to have a working model that can predict solar panel properties from molecular structures with decent accuracy. I'll know I did a good job if my code works reliably, meets our accuracy goals, and integrates with what my teammates are building. Success means delivering something the team can actually use for the next phase of the project.
