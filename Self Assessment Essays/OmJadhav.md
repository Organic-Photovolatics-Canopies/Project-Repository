Our senior design project is focused on developing organic photovoltaic (OPV) canopies for agricultural use. OPVs stand out because they can be made at lower cost and with more sustainable processes compared to traditional solar cells. Our team is adding an AI component to the project, where machine learning will help analyze data and identify design improvements. The goal is to make OPVs more efficient and practical for farmers. From my perspective, this project is exciting because it connects computer science with renewable energy. It gives me the chance to use the technical skills I’ve learned to solve a real-world problem that matters.

My computer science coursework has given me the foundation I need for this project. In CS 2028C Data Structures and CS 4071 Design and Analysis of Algorithms, I learned how to work with data efficiently, whether that means storing it, organizing it, or running algorithms to process it. Courses like CS 5173 Deep Learning and CS 5135 Learning Probabilistic Models gave me experience building and optimizing machine learning models. I also learned how to handle input data and make sure models are trained and tuned the right way. These courses showed me how theory connects with practice, and I plan to use these skills to design and refine AI models for our project. Overall, my coursework trained me to think through problems step by step and find solutions that scale.

My co-op experiences also helped me develop the technical and teamwork skills that will be important for this project. At Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, I worked as an AI/ML Engineering Intern where I built a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) to predict protein-protein interactions. I processed very large datasets, engineered embeddings, and used CUDA to speed up computations. In my earlier internship at the same hospital, I worked on optimizing machine learning pipelines with TensorFlow and Scikit-learn, improving both accuracy and runtime. These experiences gave me hands-on practice applying what I learned in class and also taught me how to work on a team, communicate results, and troubleshoot when things did not go as planned. Both the technical skills and the soft skills I built during my co-ops will be useful in moving our project forward.

I am motivated to work on this project because of the potential impact it can have on farmers. OPV canopies could provide a way to generate renewable energy while also supporting agriculture, which makes the project meaningful beyond just a technical challenge. I like the idea that our work can build on past teams and continue to push the project forward. It feels rewarding to be part of something that could have a long-term benefit. I am also interested in the chance to combine AI with renewable energy since it shows how computer science can be applied in areas outside of traditional tech. Having that connection to the real world makes me want to give my best effort.

Our first step will be to connect with the students who worked on this project before us so we understand what they accomplished. From there, we will do a literature review and then apply what we learn to build and improve the AI models. We hope to create an OPV system that performs better and adds value to the work already done. For me, success will mean not only improving the model but also learning and growing as I contribute to the project. I will test my code and models carefully, reflect on mistakes, and track what I learn along the way. I will know I have done a good job if I can say I helped move the project forward while also improving my own skills.
