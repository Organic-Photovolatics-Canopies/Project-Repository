9. Appendix

This section provides references, citations, links to code repositories, meeting
notes, and evidence of work for each team member.

**Team Meetings:**

- The CS team met twice weekly for a total of 2.5 hours per week, focusing on
  technical development, data analysis, and code review.
- The full project team also met weekly to coordinate interdisciplinary tasks
  and project milestones.

**Evidence of Effort (45+ hours per member):**

Each member will add their own contributions individually below.

- **Ido Gal:**
  - Work in progress is documented in the `progress/` folder, including:
    - Quantum chemistry dataset analysis
      ([Quantum_Chemistry_Analysis_Report.md](progress/Quantum_Chemistry_Analysis_Report.md))
    - Data cleaning and pipeline documentation
      ([dataset_documentation.md](progress/dataset_documentation.md),
      [pipeline.sql](progress/pipeline.sql))
    - Data files and analysis images (e.g., `data_calcqcset1.csv`,
      `comprehensive_analysis.png`, `database_structure_analysis.png`)
  - Researched the Harvard Clean Energy dataset, performed data cleaning, and
    prepared the data for machine learning model training. This involved:
    - Downloading, exploring, and understanding the dataset structure
    - Cleaning quantum chemistry tables using statistical filtering (see
      `dataset_documentation.md`)
    - Writing SQL and Python scripts to process and validate the data (see
      `pipeline.sql`)
    - Documenting the process and results in progress reports
